                </header>
                <p>We have listened to the feedback from the community, and we have tried our very best to turn around quickly
                    and address this feedback. Our primary focus for 3.4.2 have been around improving the quality and performance
                    of the product.</p>

                <p>The complete list of issues fixed in this version is <a href="https://github.com/Nuget/Home/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.4.2+is%3Aclosed">available on GitHub</a>.
                    In this post, we’ll review the important changes in 3.4.2 release.</p>

                <p>You can download the latest 3.4.2 VS extension and Windows x86 Commandline (RC) from <a href="https://dist.nuget.org/index.html">here</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>We continue to invest heavily in performance improvements. For this release, we have significantly improved
                        the performance of updates in a specific scenario, where updates on packages with deep dependency
                        graphs took a really long time and hung Visual Studio.</li>
                    <li>In addition to this change, we have fixed an issue where we were hitting the network twice when fetching
                        the update count in the VS UI. This was partially responsible for some timeout issues customers experienced
                        in 3.4/3.4.1.</li>
                    <li>Finally, nuget restore without network traffic is 2.5x – 3x faster within Visual Studio.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

                <p>We have fixed some issues that broke compatibility in some cases with Artifactory, Klondike and Nexus. We
                    have further improved the quality of the ‘All Sources’ feature by fixing issues with merging versions
                    and entries from multiple sources.</p>

                <p>Our <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/release-notes/nuget-3.4.2">release notes for 3.4.2</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Nuget/Home/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.4.2+is%3Aclosed">issues list in GitHub</a>,
                    goes into more details around the changes in this release.</p>

                <h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h2>

                <p>If you have not specified a <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/nuget-config-file">DefaultPushSource in nuget.config</a>,
                    and try to push a package without specifying the Source parameter, you will get the following error message
                    in 3.4.2</p>

                <p>“Source parameter was not specified”</p>

                <p>We have heard feedback from package authors and seen it in the support requests that we receive on nuget.org,
                    that having a default behavior like this causes accidental publish of proprietary software that was never
                    meant to be consumed publically. NuGet has a huge ecosystem with multiple private and public hosts and
                    this change enables authors to be prescriptive about their intentions around package publications.</p>

                <h2 id="known-issues-in-342-windows-x86-commandline-rc">Known Issues in 3.4.2 Windows x86 Commandline (RC)</h2>

                <p>These issues will be fixed early next week before we hit RTM.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Running nuget restore on a solution will fail if the solution file is placed in a lower folder hierarchy
                        than the project files.</li>
                    <li>Running nuget delete command on a package using the V2 feed will fail. Use V3 feed instead.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>

                <p>The team is cleaning up any remaining issues from the cross-platform support in conjunction with the .NET
                    Command-Line-Interface release. There are new features we want to implement around project.json capabilities,
                    and improvements to NuGet.org service that enable a smoother publication process for package authors.</p>

                    <h1><a href="http://blog.nuget.org/20160405/NuGet-3.4-Known-Issues.html">NuGet 3.4 Known Issues</a></h1>
                </header>
                <p>After releasing the NuGet 3.4 version last week, the team quickly heard feedback around an issue that made
                    the NuGet extension very difficult to use. There was a bug in the code that would prevent searching and
                    installing of packages for some users. After some researching, the team has identified the scenario that
                    causes this problem and has a work-around to report.</p>

                <p>The key to this issue is in the NuGet configuration in Visual Studio. If you see this when you enter the
                    Visual Studio Tools -&gt; Options menu and choose NuGet Package Manager -&gt; Package Sources</p>

                <center><img title="Symptom UI" src="./NuGet Team Blog_files/symptomUI.png">
                </center>

                <p>Our team has identified that this issue appears for developers who have never modified their personal NuGet.config
                    file at <code class="highlighter-rouge">%appdata%\nuget\nuget.config</code> The install for the NuGet
                    extension no longer inteprets default content for this file in memory. If you had not customized your
                    NuGet sources, the new extension would not provide this default content in memory and lead to this scenario.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, there is a simple work-around: delete the empty file on disk and restart Visual Studio 2015.
                    This will trigger the NuGet extension to save a fresh copy of the default NuGet.config file, which should
                    be the same as the one that was removed because the qualifying scenario is that it was never modified
                    in the first place.</p>

                <h2 id="a-fix--a-patch">A fix?  A Patch?</h2>

                <p>The team has identified a handful of issues that will be addressed with a <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/milestones/3.4.2">patch tentatively labeled v3.4.2 on GitHub</a>.
                    Among these are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>NuGet clients ignore no_proxy setting</li>
                    <li>‘All sources’ aggregate package source delivers duplicate entries</li>
                    <li>‘All Sources’ delayed results are not merged with existing results</li>
                    <li>VS 2015 Update 2 package update hangs</li>
                    <li>Crash when browsing sources with incorrect icon URLs</li>
                    <li>FindPackagesById casing changes in 3.4.1 breaks Artifactory integration</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The team has scheduled this 3.4.2 milestone for completion on April 9, and you should see it available for
                    download either on the 9th or shortly after that.</p>

                    <h1><a href="http://blog.nuget.org/20160330/Introducing-NuGet-3.4.html">Introducing NuGet 3.4</a></h1>
                </header>
                <p>The NuGet team is happy to introduce version 3.4 and 3.4.1 of the NuGet clients for Visual Studio 2015. We
                    shipped v3.4 with Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 and immediately followed that with the 3.4.1 release to
                    address a small set of issues that were identified after Visual Studio bundled the NuGet 3.4 release.
                    There were three main areas that the team focused on:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cross-Platform support</li>
                    <li>Improved Performance in Visual Studio</li>
                    <li>Minor user-interface improvements</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The cross-platform support is being validated, and we plan to release command-line versions of nuget.exe
                    in the coming weeks.</p>

                <p>We think you’ll find these updates a welcome change that improves your day-to-day interactions with NuGet
                    packages. The complete list of issues fixed in this version is <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues?q=milestone%3A%223.4+RTM%22+is%3Aclosed">available on GitHub</a>.
                    In this post, we’ll review the important updates in the 3.4 and 3.4.1 versions.</p>

                <h2 id="visual-studio-performance-and-all-sources">Visual Studio Performance and All Sources</h2>

                <p>In the 3.4RC we previously discussed the performance improvements in the UI. We’ve taken those performance
                    updates and added a few more things that we know you’ll be happy to see. Check this video for a quick
                    tour of the new enhancements:</p>

                <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="./NuGet Team Blog_files/W6quyUV-cxY.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

                <p>That video is not edited or enhanced for speed, that is real-time search and updates performance from outside
                    of the pristine Microsoft networks. The package lists on the Updates tab are now sorted alphabetically
                    and the ‘All Sources’ aggregate NuGet source are available for you to search across in the user-interface.</p>

                <h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

                <p>The clients have been updated to remove some of the extra interactions that felt unnecessary. For example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Packages in project.json can have a floating version number and were updating on every build regardless
                            of whether the package has an update available. The client has been optimized to only check for
                            an update and apply it when forced to restore, clean, rebuild, or after a project.json modification.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Visual Studio extension no longer are automatically adds the nuget.org repository source to your
                            nuget.config files when you use the NuGet configuration user interface.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Shared projects no longer have packages restored to them, nor is a lock file written for them</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The latest project.json schema for DNX is supported in the Visual Studio editor and by the NuGet
                            extension</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="breaking-change">Breaking Change</h2>

                <p>We are announcing a breaking change in the way that NuGet clients handle package version numbers. The clients
                    will now normalize the numbers to a format of <em>major</em>.<em>minor</em>.<em>patch</em>-<em>prerelease</em>                    where major, minor, and patch are all integers. The prerelease is treated as a string and will not be
                    modified. This means that if you search for version 1 of a package, the NuGet client will search for
                    version 1.0.0 Similaryly, if you search for package version 1.01.0.0 the client will search for version
                    1.1.0</p>

                <p>Full details of this change are available in the documents under <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/Create/Versioning#Normalized_Version_Numbers">normalized version numbers</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>

                <p>The team is cleaning up any remaining issues from the cross-platform migration in conjunction with the .NET
                    Command-Line-Interface release. There are new features we want to implement for project.json capabilities
                    and there are NuGet.org service improvements that we want to implement to better enable the publication
                    of a team’s collection of packages.</p>
